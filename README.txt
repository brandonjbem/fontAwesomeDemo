Steps to using font-awesome on your website:

STEP 1: LOAD THE CDN FROM THE FONT-AWESOME WEBSITE INTO THE HEAD OF YOUR HTML!

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.5.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">

STEP 2: THAT'S IT! YOU CAN NOW USE FONT-AWESOME ELEMENTS ON YOUR HTML AND CSS PAGES.

KEEP IN MIND THAT FONT-AWESOME IS A FONT LIBRARY, AND IS SEEN AS TEXT, NOT AN IMAGE. THESE RULES APPLY.
